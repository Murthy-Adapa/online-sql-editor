# Online SQL Editor
This is an online SQL Editor which uses WebSQL. You can try any SQL statement, and play with the Database as you like (create tables,views,write queries, drop tables, columns etc.,). The Database can be restored at any time, simply by clicking the "Restore Database". By default a demo database gets created in the browser locally for testing. WebSQL is supported in Chrome, Safari, and Opera.
